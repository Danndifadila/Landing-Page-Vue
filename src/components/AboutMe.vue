    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>
      I’m a Vocational High School <strong>student with a strong curiosity </strong>for technology,
      design, and how they can empower people and businesses. I’m
      <strong>currently learning JavaScript </strong> and web development, with a growing
      <strong> interest in how great user experiences are built—not just from code </strong>, but
      from empathy, creativity, and purpose.
    </h2>
    <br />
    <h2>
      <strong> I believe in continuous learning and thoughtful problem-solving </strong>. Whether
      it's building interfaces, exploring the world of programming, or collaborating in a team,
      <strong
        >I always aim to create work that’s meaningful, functional, and visually thoughtful.
      </strong>
