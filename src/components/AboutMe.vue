  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>
   I’m a Vocational High School <strong>student with a  strong curiosity </strong>for technology, design, and how they can empower people and businesses. I’m <strong>currently learning JavaScript </strong> and web development, with a growing <strong> interest in how great user experiences are built—not just from code </strong>, but from empathy, creativity, and purpose.
  </h2>
<br/>
  <h2>
    <strong> I believe in continuous learning and thoughtful problem-solving </strong>. Whether it's building interfaces, exploring the world of programming, or collaborating in a team, <strong>I always aim to create work that’s meaningful, functional, and visually thoughtful. </strong>
